Paracord Bracelet Mount | Natural Tick Repellent Bracelet | EM Ceramics Bracelet | Gray and Black Color | Unisex Adjustable Bracelet,14.06,48.0,CreativeTwines,"['Handmade item\n\nBracelet length: 30 Centimetres; Bracelet width: 1 Centimetres\n\nMaterials: Ceramic, Nylon, Polyester', 'Adjustable: Yes', 'Style: Boho & hippie', 'Can be personalised: Yes', 'Made to Order']","Our paracord bracelets with EM ceramics are a natural tick and flea repellent. They also make a beautiful accessory for you or a gift for your loved ones. Each bracelet is handwoven with quality 550 Paracord and EM ceramic pipes.Material: Paracord and EM ceramicsColour: Gray and BlackSize (approx.): L30 cm (11.81″) / W1 cm (0.39″)Weight: 30 gClosure: Double Fisherman’s BendHOW DOES IT WORK?EM (Effective Microorganism) ceramics emit far infrared waves, the longest rays in the light spectrum. This wavelength is highly compatible with human and animal tissue. The body can absorb them easily at depths up to 7.60 cm or 3 inches, where they can do lots of good work. Far Infrared waves remove blood cell clusters which improve blood circulation. Because the infrared rays penetrate the tissue, they work deep into body tissue, not just on the surface of the skin. Far infrared waves generate a warming effect by activating cells. NASA uses Far Infrared wave technology in the spacesuits of their astronauts.This improved and balanced environment (created by EM) can help keep ticks from attaching to your skin.These bracelets also make great personal protective jewellery that is fun to wear and provides protection against electromagnetic fields that are emitted from many common electronic devices we use every day. Our bracelets are lightweight and come in a variety of colours and sizes to match any outfit.WHAT ARE EM CERAMICS?EM ceramics are made by fermenting a special clay with approximately 80 different microorganisms (EM) and then baked. The pipes are baked at 1200 C, because in the baking process the structure of the clay changes, trapping the EM within its matrix. As a result, these EM pipes exert their influence purely through their physical properties and remain effective for a long time. Our EM tick guard bracelet can be as effective as any tick repellent found on the market but without side effects. That makes it also safe for people with allergies and sensitivities. However, there is no 100% guarantee EM bracelets nor any other tick product will keep ticks off. The best prevention is to avoid known tick areas and to check yourself for ticks after every nature walk.EM ceramics are safe for children and other pets to be around. Literature available suggests that paracord EM bracelets reduce in effectiveness after 10 – 12 months. It is therefore recommended that you renew your paracord EM bracelet every year at the start of tick season.HOW TO USE AND CARE FOR YOUR PARACORD EM BRACELET?1)	You will get the best results when you wear the bracelet 24 hours. It is recommended to keep the paracord bracelet on at all times during the tick season. 2)	Every 20 days, rinse the bracelet thoroughly under warm tap water and let it dry in the sun. Do not use soap or other chemicals! It is very important to keep the pipes clean. You can also use a soft brush if you want to.3)	If you are using essential oils or a bug spray in addition to the bracelet, make sure the EM ceramic pipes stay oil/fat-free.4)	Swimming with the EM bracelet is not a problem just let it dry in the sun afterwards. It is not recommended to be used in pool water with bleach or other chemicals in it.",In stock,1

They also make a beautiful accessory for you or a gift for your loved ones. Each bracelet is handwoven with quality 550 Paracord and EM ceramic pipes.Material: Paracord and EM ceramicsColour: Gray and BlackSize (approx.): L30 cm (11.81″) / W1 cm (0.39″)Weight: 30 gClosure: Double Fisherman’s BendHOW DOES IT WORK?EM (Effective Microorganism) ceramics emit far infrared waves, the longest rays in the light spectrum. This wavelength is highly compatible with human and animal tissue. The body can absorb them easily at depths up to 7.60 cm or 3 inches, where they can do lots of good work. Far Infrared waves remove blood cell clusters which improve blood circulation. Because the infrared rays penetrate the tissue, they work deep into body tissue, not just on the surface of the skin. Far infrared waves generate a warming effect by activating cells. NASA uses Far Infrared wave technology in the spacesuits of their astronauts.This improved and balanced environment (created by EM) can help keep ticks from attaching to your skin.These bracelets also make great personal protective jewellery that is fun to wear and provides protection against electromagnetic fields that are emitted from many common electronic devices we use every day. Our bracelets are lightweight and come in a variety of colours and sizes to match any outfit.WHAT ARE EM CERAMICS?EM ceramics are made by fermenting a special clay with approximately 80 different microorganisms (EM) and then baked. The pipes are baked at 1200 C, because in the baking process the structure of the clay changes, trapping the EM within its matrix. As a result, these EM pipes exert their influence purely through their physical properties and remain effective for a long time. Our EM tick guard bracelet can be as effective as any tick repellent found on the market but without side effects. That makes it also safe for people with allergies and sensitivities. However, there is no 100% guarantee EM bracelets nor any other tick product will keep ticks off. The best prevention is to avoid known tick areas and to check yourself for ticks after every nature walk.EM ceramics are safe for children and other pets to be around. Literature available suggests that paracord EM bracelets reduce in effectiveness after 10 – 12 months. It is therefore recommended that you renew your paracord EM bracelet every year at the start of tick season.HOW TO USE AND CARE FOR YOUR PARACORD EM BRACELET?1)	You will get the best results when you wear the bracelet 24 hours. It is recommended to keep the paracord bracelet on at all times during the tick season. 2)	Every 20 days, rinse the bracelet thoroughly under warm tap water and let it dry in the sun. Do not use soap or other chemicals! It is very important to keep the pipes clean. You can also use a soft brush if you want to.3)	If you are using essential oils or a bug spray in addition to the bracelet, make sure the EM ceramic pipes stay oil/fat-free.4)	Swimming with the EM bracelet is not a problem just let it dry in the sun afterwards. It is not recommended to be used in pool water with bleach or other chemicals in it.",In stock,1

They also make a beautiful accessory for you or a gift for your loved ones. Each bracelet is handwoven with quality 550 Paracord and EM ceramic pipes.Material: Paracord and EM ceramicsColour: Blue and BlackSize (approx.): L30 cm (11.81″) / W1 cm (0.39″)Weight: 30 gClosure: Double Fisherman’s BendHOW DOES IT WORK?EM (Effective Microorganism) ceramics emit far infrared waves, the longest rays in the light spectrum. This wavelength is highly compatible with human and animal tissue. The body can absorb them easily at depths up to 7.60 cm or 3 inches, where they can do lots of good work. Far Infrared waves remove blood cell clusters which improve blood circulation. Because the infrared rays penetrate the tissue, they work deep into body tissue, not just on the surface of the skin. Far infrared waves generate a warming effect by activating cells. NASA uses Far Infrared wave technology in the spacesuits of their astronauts.This improved and balanced environment (created by EM) can help keep ticks from attaching to your skin.These bracelets also make great personal protective jewellery that is fun to wear and provides protection against electromagnetic fields that are emitted from many common electronic devices we use every day. Our bracelets are lightweight and come in a variety of colours and sizes to match any outfit.WHAT ARE EM CERAMICS?EM ceramics are made by fermenting a special clay with approximately 80 different microorganisms (EM) and then baked. The pipes are baked at 1200 C, because in the baking process the structure of the clay changes, trapping the EM within its matrix. As a result, these EM pipes exert their influence purely through their physical properties and remain effective for a long time. Our EM tick guard bracelet can be as effective as any tick repellent found on the market but without side effects. That makes it also safe for people with allergies and sensitivities. However, there is no 100% guarantee EM bracelets nor any other tick product will keep ticks off. The best prevention is to avoid known tick areas and to check yourself for ticks after every nature walk.EM ceramics are safe for children and other pets to be around. Literature available suggests that paracord EM bracelets reduce in effectiveness after 10 – 12 months. It is therefore recommended that you renew your paracord EM bracelet every year at the start of tick season.HOW TO USE AND CARE FOR YOUR PARACORD EM BRACELET?1)	You will get the best results when you wear the bracelet 24 hours. It is recommended to keep the paracord bracelet on at all times during the tick season. 2)	Every 20 days, rinse the bracelet thoroughly under warm tap water and let it dry in the sun. Do not use soap or other chemicals! It is very important to keep the pipes clean. You can also use a soft brush if you want to.3)	If you are using essential oils or a bug spray in addition to the bracelet, make sure the EM ceramic pipes stay oil/fat-free.4)	Swimming with the EM bracelet is not a problem just let it dry in the sun afterwards. It is not recommended to be used in pool water with bleach or other chemicals in it.",In stock,1

Tarnish develops due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the air or in any materials that come into contact with the silver.Unlike rust, tarnish is a ‘self-limiting’ patina, affecting only the top few layers and ultimately protecting the metal. While this is good news overall, it is not particularly pretty.If your sterling silver is already tarnished, try clean it immediately to avoid future tarnishing.

They also make a beautiful accessory for you or a gift for your loved ones.

This wavelength is highly compatible with human and animal tissue. The body can absorb them easily at depths up to 7.60 cm or 3 inches, where they can do lots of good work. Far Infrared waves remove blood cell clusters which improve blood circulation. Because the infrared rays penetrate the tissue, they work deep into body tissue, not just on the surface of the skin. Far infrared waves generate a warming effect by activating cells. NASA uses Far Infrared wave technology in the spacesuits of their astronauts.This improved and balanced environment (created by EM) can help keep ticks from attaching to your skin.These bracelets also make great personal protective jewellery that is fun to wear and provides protection against electromagnetic fields that are emitted from many common electronic devices we use every day. Our bracelets are lightweight and come in a variety of colours and sizes to match any outfit.WHAT ARE EM CERAMICS?EM ceramics are made by fermenting a special clay with approximately 80 different microorganisms (EM) and then baked. The pipes are baked at 1200 C, because in the baking process the structure of the clay changes, trapping the EM within its matrix. As a result, these EM pipes exert their influence purely through their physical properties and remain effective for a long time. Our EM tick guard bracelet can be as effective as any tick repellent found on the market but without side effects. That makes it also safe for people with allergies and sensitivities. However, there is no 100% guarantee EM bracelets nor any other tick product will keep ticks off. The best prevention is to avoid known tick areas and to check yourself for ticks after every nature walk.EM ceramics are safe for children and other pets to be around. Literature available suggests that paracord EM bracelets reduce in effectiveness after 10 – 12 months. It is therefore recommended that you renew your paracord EM bracelet every year at the start of tick season.HOW TO USE AND CARE FOR YOUR PARACORD EM BRACELET?1)	You will get the best results when you wear the bracelet 24 hours. It is recommended to keep the paracord bracelet on at all times during the tick season. 2)	Every 20 days, rinse the bracelet thoroughly under warm tap water and let it dry in the sun. Do not use soap or other chemicals! It is very important to keep the pipes clean. You can also use a soft brush if you want to.3)	If you are using essential oils or a bug spray in addition to the bracelet, make sure the EM ceramic pipes stay oil/fat-free.4)	Swimming with the EM bracelet is not a problem just let it dry in the sun afterwards.

Tarnish develops due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the air or in any materials that come into contact with the silver.Unlike rust, tarnish is a ‘self-limiting’ patina, affecting only the top few layers and ultimately protecting the metal. While this is good news overall, it is not particularly pretty.If your sterling silver is already tarnished, try clean it immediately to avoid future tarnishing. Use a polishing cloth made especially for silver. If the tarnish is beyond repair using a cloth, try a silver wash. If this doesn't work, you can visit a jewelry who has special equipment to rid silver of tarnish. ★ SHIPPING and TERMS ★We ship worldwide with regular avia mailwith registered tracking number.Shippingto US - 10-20 working days;to Canada -14-25 working days;(Canada Post don't scan tracking numbers)to EU - 5-20 working days;(except Italy and Germany)to Australia and NZ - 14-30 working days;★ WE ARE HERE FOR YOU ★Dear customer, if you have any questions - don't hesitate to contact me! :)★ Check out our shop on ETSY ★https://www.etsy.com/shop/UniqueHistoryShopAnd don't hesitate to contact me! :)",Only 1 available,3

(See Photo Example) 2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your EXACT wrist size. That is what we need! 3)  Order this Exact wrist size when checking out, and you are good to go! Side notes:  If you are in-between sizes, round UP! The nearest size will be comfortable. Please remember not to compensate for slack as we do that here in-house.Lastly, if you have any questions or need any help, send us a message and we will gladly answer any questions and walk through the steps with you.

Help the gods. Sacred runic word.Of all the runic formulas, the crypt ᚨᛚᚢ which is a combination of the runes Ansus, Laguz, Uruz, is the most famous and used from the rather big heritage of ancient runescripts. The word is very old, because it is found on pendants, bracteates and rings in cultural layers that belong to the era of the birth of the Elder Futhark (as we know it today). This is about the 2nd centuryLet us give a classic example of decoding this formula. A.L.U .:Ansus is a Higher Power. Voice and Will of the Gods. She also represents plenty and a good harvest.Laguz symbolizes Water. This is the Flow, the Energy of Life. And clean thoughts. As well as Organic Development.Uruz is necessary to develop potential. Embodies the essence of fertilization and raw, basic energy.Actually, this is a formula provided by the gods (well, or by the Higher Forces, which should be one principle, in fact) of assistance in a certain enterprise, where the questioner is an active participant. Include yourself in the stream, in which there is a potential opportunity to manifest what already exists (but asleep, waiting to fall into a suitable environment).

However, should you get it wet, be advised paracord will shrink a little bit. Paracord is virtually indestructible (rubbing or cutting, of course would cause damage) with many uses. It's mildew and rot resistant. It can be used in many emergency survival situations from normal day to day activities to the extreme survival situations. A few examples are: shoe lace replacement, tie down cargo, tourniquet, or a snare for catching food. Each strand of paracord contains a core of seven individual strands. Those are also useful for such as sewing for tent repair, fishing line, clothing repair, fishing net repairs, or a bow for fire starting. Ultimately, it is an easy, convenient way to carry a small amount of rope in a trendy and fashionable manner.Remember that colors may vary slightly due to computer monitor settings.

Tarnish develops due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the air or in any materials that come into contact with the silver.Unlike rust, tarnish is a ‘self-limiting’ patina, affecting only the top few layers and ultimately protecting the metal. While this is good news overall, it is not particularly pretty.If your sterling silver is already tarnished, try clean it immediately to avoid future tarnishing. Use a polishing cloth made especially for silver. If the tarnish is beyond repair using a cloth, try a silver wash. If this doesn't work, you can visit a jewelry who has special equipment to rid silver of tarnish. ★ SHIPPING and TERMS ★We ship worldwide with regular avia mailwith registered tracking number.Shippingto US - 10-20 working days;to Canada -14-25 working days;(Canada Post don't scan tracking numbers)to EU - 5-20 working days;(except Italy and Germany)to Australia and NZ - 14-30 working days;★ WE ARE HERE FOR YOU ★Dear customer, if you have any questions - don't hesitate to contact me! :)★ Check out our shop on ETSY ★https://www.etsy.com/shop/UniqueHistoryShopAnd don't hesitate to contact me! :)",Only 1 available,3

I ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:1) Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT! If you do not provide the correct measurement, the bracelet will not fit. All of my bracelets are made to the measurement you select. The bracelet will fit comfortable as long as you follow these instructions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

We hope to embrace all that they bring to our World.I love how I can use Hand Stamping and Laser Etching, to create truly unique items tailored to you. Each piece that I make can never be duplicated or replicated. There will be slight variations between each one. This is because with hand stamping, I use a little metal stamp and a hammer to punch out your words or designs all one letter at a time! When we use the laser to etch, the laser can add slight variations to the depth of the etching due to the specific piece of metal it is working with. We cater to each piece of metal by polishing it and then molding it in to the beautiful creations you see in my shop! As life is a little bit messy and not always perfect, my pieces represent this well! Not everything will always line up perfect, like a machine would, and this will add so much more character to your items!

Tarnish develops due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the air or in any materials that come into contact with the silver.Unlike rust, tarnish is a ‘self-limiting’ patina, affecting only the top few layers and ultimately protecting the metal. While this is good news overall, it is not particularly pretty.If your sterling silver is already tarnished, try clean it immediately to avoid future tarnishing. Use a polishing cloth made especially for silver. If the tarnish is beyond repair using a cloth, try a silver wash. If this doesn't work, you can visit a jewelry who has special equipment to rid silver of tarnish. ★ SHIPPING and TERMS ★We ship worldwide with regular avia mailwith registered tracking number.Shippingto US - 10-20 working days;to Canada -14-25 working days;(Canada Post don't scan tracking numbers)to EU - 5-20 working days;(except Italy and Germany)to Australia and NZ - 14-30 working days;★ WE ARE HERE FOR YOU ★Dear customer, if you have any questions - don't hesitate to contact me! :)★ Check out our shop on ETSY ★https://www.etsy.com/shop/UniqueHistoryShopAnd don't hesitate to contact me! :)",In stock,3

I want the size of your wrist, NOT the length you would like the bracelet. I ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:1) Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT! If you do not provide the correct measurement, the bracelet will not fit. All of my bracelets are made to the measurement you select. The bracelet will fit comfortable as long as you follow these instructions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT!

Thank you!I make items to REPRESENT YOUR LIFE and who you are! I love how I can use Hand Stamping and Laser Etching, to create truly unique items tailored to you. Each piece that I make can never be duplicated or replicated. There will be slight variations between each one. This is because with hand stamping, I use a little metal stamp and a hammer to punch out your words or designs all one letter at a time! When we use the laser to etch, the laser can add slight variations to the depth of the etching due to the specific piece of metal it is working with. We cater to each piece of metal by polishing it and then molding it in to the beautiful creations you see in my shop! As life is a little bit messy and not always perfect, my pieces represent this well! Not everything will always line up perfect, like a machine would, and this will add so much more character to your items! So much heart is put into each piece, as well as a little bit of love that is continuously carried through each one, as it tells your story! We can't wait to get started on your One-of-a-Kind items, and tell your story!",In stock,6

If you do not know your size, do NOT guess. I have had a number of exchanges due to wrong sizes. Mostly because measurements were not accurate as they were estimated. When taking your measurement, please do NOT add or take off anything. I need the exact size as it shows. You can find measuring instructions below.There will be a $5.00 charge to remake the item plus $8.00 shipping charge to reprint a domestic USPS Priority Mail Label or a $25.00 to reprint an international shipping label. As stated in my policy, the buyer is responsible for the cost to mail it back to me.***IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SIZING***  To find out your correct wrist size, follow these instructions:First, measure your wrist with a garment measuring tape and pull snug around your wrist.  Do not add any extra length to the measurement. I will add the extra length as needed to fit your wrist depending on the weave and style of the bracelet.If you don't have a measuring tape, you can use a piece of thread or cord. Wrap the thread or cord around your wrist snug and mark where the two ends meet. Lay down the thread or cord next to a straight edge ruler to find the measurement. That is your wrist measurement. If your wrist size is for example seven and a quarter inches, round it up to the next half inch. In this case, 7.5 inches. I will add the additional length  for comfort.If you are measuring your wrist in centimeters, send me that measurement exactly as it shows and I will make the necessary adjustment to find your size in inches.If you think you know your wrist size, I recommend to measure it again to make sure your wrist size has not changed.

If you do not know your size, do NOT guess. I have had a number of exchanges due to wrong sizes. Mostly because measurements were not accurate as they were estimated. When taking your measurement, please do NOT add or take off anything. I need the exact size as it shows.

Do not add any extra length to the measurement. I will add the extra length as needed to fit your wrist depending on the weave and style of the bracelet.If you don't have a measuring tape, you can use a piece of thread or cord. Wrap the thread or cord around your wrist snug and mark where the two ends meet. Lay down the thread or cord next to a straight edge ruler to find the measurement. That is your wrist measurement. If your wrist size is for example seven and a quarter inches, round it up to the next half inch. In this case, 7.5 inches. I will add the additional length  for comfort.If you are measuring your wrist in centimeters, send me that measurement exactly as it shows and I will make the necessary adjustment to find your size in inches.If you think you know your wrist size, I recommend to measure it again to make sure your wrist size has not changed.

EXAMPLE OF COLORS USEDcolor edge - Blackcolor inside - Blackcolor center line & ribbon - Rose PinkHOW TO MEASURE YOUR WRISTI custom make each bracelet based on your exact wrist measurement. I want the size of your wrist, NOT the length you would like the bracelet. I ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:1) Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT! If you do not provide the correct measurement, the bracelet will not fit. All of my bracelets are made to the measurement you select. The bracelet will fit comfortable as long as you follow these instructions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Please note: There is a $15.00 resizing fee for all re-braided products with wrong measurements. That’s why we ask you follow these 3 steps closely: (See Photo Example)1)   Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack. (See Photo Example) 2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your EXACT wrist size. That is what we need! 3)  Order this Exact wrist size when checking out, and you are good to go! Side notes:  If you are in-between sizes, round UP! The nearest size will be comfortable. Please remember not to compensate for slack as we do that here in-house.Lastly, if you have any questions or need any help, send us a message and we will gladly answer any questions and walk through the steps with you.

Please choose your color from the drop down menu.************************************************************************************Bracelet is suitable for getting wet. However, should you get it wet, be advised paracord will shrink a little bit. Paracord is virtually indestructible (rubbing or cutting, of course would cause damage) with many uses. It's mildew and rot resistant. It can be used in many emergency survival situations from normal day to day activities to the extreme survival situations. A few examples are: shoe lace replacement, tie down cargo, tourniquet, or a snare for catching food. Each strand of paracord contains a core of seven individual strands. Those are also useful for such as sewing for tent repair, fishing line, clothing repair, fishing net repairs, or a bow for fire starting. Ultimately, it is an easy, convenient way to carry a small amount of rope in a trendy and fashionable manner.Remember that colors may vary slightly due to computer monitor settings.

If you do not know your size, do NOT guess. I have had a number of exchanges due to wrong sizes. Mostly because measurements were not accurate as they were estimated. When taking your measurement, please do NOT add or take off anything. I need the exact size as it shows. You can find measuring instructions below.There will be a $5.00 charge to remake the item plus $8.00 shipping charge to reprint a domestic USPS Priority Mail Label or a $25.00 to reprint an international shipping label. As stated in my policy, the buyer is responsible for the cost to mail it back to me.***IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SIZING***  To find out your correct wrist size, follow these instructions:First, measure your wrist with a garment measuring tape and pull snug around your wrist.  Do not add any extra length to the measurement. I will add the extra length as needed to fit your wrist depending on the weave and style of the bracelet.If you don't have a measuring tape, you can use a piece of thread or cord. Wrap the thread or cord around your wrist snug and mark where the two ends meet. Lay down the thread or cord next to a straight edge ruler to find the measurement. That is your wrist measurement. If your wrist size is for example seven and a quarter inches, round it up to the next half inch. In this case, 7.5 inches. I will add the additional length  for comfort.If you are measuring your wrist in centimeters, send me that measurement exactly as it shows and I will make the necessary adjustment to find your size in inches.If you think you know your wrist size, I recommend to measure it again to make sure your wrist size has not changed.

I want the size of your wrist, NOT the length you would like the bracelet. I ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:1) Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT! If you do not provide the correct measurement, the bracelet will not fit. All of my bracelets are made to the measurement you select. The bracelet will fit comfortable as long as you follow these instructions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

His Thin Purple Line Paracord Bracelet,11.13,97.0,8thLineApparel,"['Handmade item', 'Materials: Paracoard, Buckle', 'Closure: Buckle', 'Made to Order']","Purple has along been used by the Military to denote sacrifice of being wounded or killed while serving. This has since extended to Politicians and those in political capacity who were wounded or killed. Taking this a step further, the Funeral industry utilized Purple strobe lights or Purple flashing lights when leading Funeral Processions. In 1570 with the promulgation of the Roman Missal after the Council of Trent, Catholicism uses Purple as the color sacrifice, penance and preparation. This is why Priests wear the Purple vestments during Funeral rituals. Since Purple was considered a Noble color (due to the costs of production), the dead are honored with the use of the color. This representation has metastasized into the modern version for the honoring of the wounded and killed during the course of their public service.",Only 1 available,16

Paracord is virtually indestructible (rubbing or cutting, of course would cause damage) with many uses. It's mildew and rot resistant. It can be used in many emergency survival situations from normal day to day activities to the extreme survival situations. A few examples are: shoe lace replacement, tie down cargo, tourniquet, or a snare for catching food. Each strand of paracord contains a core of seven individual strands. Those are also useful for such as sewing for tent repair, fishing line, clothing repair, fishing net repairs, or a bow for fire starting. Ultimately, it is an easy, convenient way to carry a small amount of rope in a trendy and fashionable manner.Remember that colors may vary slightly due to computer monitor settings.

Never leave either bracelet or blade in standing water or leave wet for extended periods of time.  Though we do not offer replacements due to water damage; in case of accidental submersion or prolonged water exposure, we recommend the wearing of rubber gloves to separate battery from buckle housing, and placing in a ziplock bag atop dry rice to allow it to more thoroughly dry for at least 8 hours or overnight.  Due to the nature of knives themselves, Knife buckles can be dangerous, especially for minors or impaired users.  Do not open or put on Knife buckle while moving or operating a vehicle, use responsibly, and keep out of reach of children.  LED lights should also be used judiciously, and are not for close eye viewing or contact.  Not to be used as a life line.  Drake Escape assumes no liability for negligent use.

Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size.

That is what we need! 3)  Order this Exact wrist size when checking out, and you are good to go! Side notes:  If you are in-between sizes, round UP! The nearest size will be comfortable.

The “Overcome” line was the inspiration behind the many custom paracord lines we have recently released.When our friends J and his wife Erica had contacted us 2 years ago, asking to create something unique with paracord, that could incorporate his battle uniforms, preferably, into a paracord bracelet, to tie in to the release of his first book “The Trident”, we were definitely ‘up to the challenge’!  After many months of working and reworking prototypes, we were able to master a way of using his uniforms, with his motto phrase “overcome” embroidered onto the uniform, and then hand woven into paracord. Each uniform piece (we call a ‘tag’) is embroidered, then seamed up, and hand woven into paracord to create a sturdy and very unique paracord bracelet.1500+ Overcome bracelets later, we decided it was time to create this line for others and give back in other ways. We began working on prototypes for different areas of life & currently have bracelets for military (all disciplines), collegiate, faith, children, everyday wear.  The possibilities are endless, due to the originality of ‘how the tag is embroidered, sewn & woven into the paracord’.  Customization is up to the individual & we couldn’t be prouder of our product.Special Thanks to J & Erica for their trust and patronage to Warriors Heart, in allowing us to be such an intregal part in the creation of the Overcome line.  Its been a true honor to work with J and Erica, & we are very proud of our custom creation & where it is taking us in our mission of helping others.God Bless our Heroes.Thank you for your Patronage,God Bless,Maryanne Michaelwww.warriorsheartcollection.com",Only 1 available,8

I want the size of your wrist, NOT the length you would like the bracelet. I ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:1) Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT! If you do not provide the correct measurement, the bracelet will not fit. All of my bracelets are made to the measurement you select.

This has since extended to Politicians and those in political capacity who were wounded or killed. Taking this a step further, the Funeral industry utilized Purple strobe lights or Purple flashing lights when leading Funeral Processions. In 1570 with the promulgation of the Roman Missal after the Council of Trent, Catholicism uses Purple as the color sacrifice, penance and preparation. This is why Priests wear the Purple vestments during Funeral rituals. Since Purple was considered a Noble color (due to the costs of production), the dead are honored with the use of the color. This representation has metastasized into the modern version for the honoring of the wounded and killed during the course of their public service.",Only 1 available,16

EXAMPLE:color edge- Colonial Bluecolor inside- Silver Graycolor center line- Black*****MORE NFL TEAMS AVAILABLE*****HOW TO MEASURE YOUR WRISTI custom make each bracelet based on your exact wrist measurement. I want the size of your wrist, NOT the length you would like the bracelet. I ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:1) Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT! If you do not provide the correct measurement, the bracelet will not fit. All of my bracelets are made to the measurement you select. The bracelet will fit comfortable as long as you follow these instructions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I want the size of your wrist, NOT the length you would like the bracelet. I ask that you follow these 3 steps closely:1) Take a tape measure, string, or scotch tape and wrap it around your wrist to where the two ends touch and there isn’t any slack. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be so tight that it cuts off your circulation, but merely a true wrist size without slack.2) Mark this exact length on your string and use a ruler to determine your true wrist size.3) Order this exact wrist size from the drop down menu, and you are good to go!Side notes: If you are in-between sizes, round up to the nearest 1/4"". Example: If your exact wrist measurement is 6 3/8"" you need to order a 6 1/2"" wrist measurement. Please remember not to compensate for slack as I do that here in-house based on your true size. You may also leave a message with your exact wrist measurement in the notes section at checkout. You can see the instruction sheet above which will show you how to get a correct wrist measurement. DO NOT measure another bracelet or watch, including another paracord bracelet that you may have. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA LENGTH TO YOUR MEASUREMENT! If you do not provide the correct measurement, the bracelet will not fit. All of my bracelets are made to the measurement you select. The bracelet will fit comfortable as long as you follow these instructions. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
